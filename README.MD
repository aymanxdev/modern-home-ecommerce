# modern-home-ecommerce
Clean and modern online shop. React and Node application for home furniture e-commerce site


[Live site](https://tiny-home-shop.herokuapp.com/)

##Steps to run this project

in your terminal run `git clone "my repo"` 
use the same endpoints that are already deployed to heroku so you dont have to run the server locally. If you want to do that, it's also fairly simple and all you need is to create a database on Monogodb, create JWT secret ke, and Stripe account 

I'm looking to improve the admin dashboard to have more features
